# ðŸŽµ Downloads Folder

All your downloaded YouTube Music playlists will appear here, organized by folder.

## Automatic structure

- Each playlist = a separate folder
- MP3 files 320kbps with metadata
- Folder names automatically cleaned
- Duplicate handling with suffixes (_1, _2, etc.)

## Example structure

```
downloads/
â”œâ”€â”€ My Rock Playlist/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Song 1.mp3
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Song 2.mp3
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Song 3.mp3
â”œâ”€â”€ My Pop Favorites/

â””â”€â”€ Chill Vibes/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Relaxing Track 1.mp3
    â””â”€â”€ Ambient Sound.mp3
```

## Notes

- Special characters in playlist names are automatically cleaned for filesystem compatibility
- If a playlist already exists, duplicate songs are skipped
- All files include proper metadata (title, artist, album when available)
- Files are saved in high quality MP3 format (320kbps)
